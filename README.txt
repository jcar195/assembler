Project Title:
The goal of this project is to create an SIC/XE assembler.

Getting Started:
	Prerequisites:
	Java IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans or other).

	Installing:
	https://www.eclipse.org/downloads

Built With:
Eclipse

Instructions to Run:
If you have the entire project in a directory, then open/import the project
from that file directory in your Java IDE.

If you have seperate files, create a new java project and package 
all the java files under package "assembler" and leave all the 
text files outside of the package.

Once the project has run, the results will be in "intermediate.txt" and 
"intermediate.txt.obj".

Versioning:
Handled in GitHub private repository.

Issues and Maintenance:
Currently, only the "basic.txt" example works correctly. The other examples
will generate the object program but since we did not complete the code, some
of the records will not be accurate as we are treating operations that we did not
complete(code for) as not generating object code for debugging purposes. Also, modification
records are not included in the code.
